# ChatApp
**ChatApp1**: Asp.net core 8 + Javascript + SignalR + RazorPage MVC project \
**ChatApp2**: Asp.net Core 8 web API + React.js + SignalR full-stack project 

These are  example apps from Microsoft Documents or another Internet source. \
In my opinion, the best way to learn a new framework or tool is from their official documents.   
Happy Coding! 🫀

how to add a client library in Visual Studio? the following steps:
```
In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, and select Add > Client-Side Library.

In the Add Client-Side Library dialog:

Select unpkg for Provider
Enter @microsoft/signalr@latest for Library.
Select Choose specific files, expand the dist/browser folder, and select signalr.js and signalr.min.js.
Set Target Location to wwwroot/js/signalr/.
Select Install.
```

In  a real-time app, it needs both frontend and backend to work together, like in a restaurant. we have servers and cookers. sometimes the server orders food,  sometimes, when there are some issues, the cooker needs to notice the servers actively.
Just try to know how it works, then check up the documents. not try to remember all the codes.
